# Comparinng-Financial-Optimization-Models
This project involves the analysis of 20 assets from December 2010 to June 2011. Its main focus is on constructing and comparing portfolios that are created using three financial optimization models. Additionally, a market capitalization-weighted portfolio is used as a baseline, assuming that the 20 stocks represent the overall market.
